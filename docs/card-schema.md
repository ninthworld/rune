# Card schema

RUNE cards are versioned functional definitions: structured, printing-independent data the
engine executes. The model is defined by [ADR 0018](decisions/0018-scalable-functional-card-definitions.md),
with the card/printing split retained from
[ADR 0013](decisions/0013-card-identity-and-set-model.md).

The Rust authorities are `CardData` and `Printing` in
`crates/rune-engine/src/card.rs`; validators live in `src/catalog.rs`.

## File layout

- `crates/rune-engine/data/catalog/<functional_id>.json` contains one functional
  definition. The file stem must equal its `functional_id`.
- `crates/rune-engine/data/sets/<SET>.json` contains that set’s printing records. A
  printing refers to a functional definition and carries no rules.

`build.rs` discovers, validates, sorts, and embeds both directories at compile time. The
running engine performs no filesystem I/O.

## Functional definition

The bundled catalog's functional definitions are sourced from a real set (Core Set 2019);
see [ADR 0026](decisions/0026-real-functional-card-data.md). Only functional data is stored —
no Oracle text, flavor, art, or branding.

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "functional_id": "skyscanner",
  "name": "Skyscanner",
  "types": ["artifact", "creature"],
  "subtypes": ["Thopter"],
  "mana_cost": "{3}",
  "colors": [],
  "power": 1,
  "toughness": 1,
  "keywords": ["flying"],
  "abilities": [
    {
      "type": "triggered",
      "event": "self_enters_battlefield",
      "effects": [{ "kind": "draw_card", "count": 1 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema_version` | yes | Must equal `rune_engine::SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently `1` |
| `functional_id` | yes | Stable lowercase `snake_case` identity; must match the file name |
| `name` | yes | Display name |
| `types` | yes | One or more card types such as `creature`, `land`, or `instant` |
| `supertypes` | no | Values such as `basic` or `legendary` |
| `subtypes` | no | Printed subtype names such as `Elf` or `Aura` |
| `mana_cost` | yes | Curly-brace notation; empty when the card has no mana cost |
| `colors` | no | Explicit card colors; empty means colorless |
| `power`, `toughness` | conditional | Both required for creatures and forbidden for non-creatures |
| `keywords` | no | Supported keyword abilities |
| `abilities` | no | Activated, triggered, or replacement-style ability IR |
| `spell_effects` | no | Resolution effects for instants and sorceries |
| `aura` | no | Aura enchant restriction and static power/toughness grant |
| `scripted` | no | Declares behavior implemented in `src/scripted.rs`; defaults to `false` |

Current keyword values are `flying`, `reach`, `vigilance`, `haste`, `first_strike`,
`trample`, `deathtouch`, and `lifelink`.

The full `abilities`, `spell_effects`, target, cost, and Aura shapes are the enums in
`crates/rune-engine/src/ability.rs`. Those Rust types are authoritative; do not reproduce
the IR in a second documentation schema that can drift.

## Closed schema and generated text

`CardData` uses `deny_unknown_fields`. A definition cannot contain exact Oracle text,
flavor text, image paths or URLs, official symbols or frames, artist credit, watermarks,
or arbitrary presentation fields. Unknown fields fail parsing.

Definitions contain no rules-prose field. `crates/rune-server/src/rules_text.rs` generates
`CardView.rules_text` from the same structured behavior the engine executes. Formatter
matches are exhaustive, so adding an IR variant without display support fails compilation.

A scripted card is the exception because its Rust behavior cannot be inspected by the
formatter. It must provide its own non-Oracle explanatory text beside the code in
`src/scripted.rs`. Loader validation requires the catalog’s `scripted` flag and the code
registration to agree in both directions.

## Printing record

```json
{
  "functional_id": "skyscanner",
  "collector_number": "19",
  "rarity": "common"
}
```

All three fields are required. `rarity` is one of `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, or
`mythic`. The set code comes from the file name. A printing must resolve to an existing
functional definition, and collector numbers must be unique within a set.

## Identity model

| Layer | Type | Assigned by | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functional card | `FunctionalId` | Card author | Stable across builds |
| Engine handle | `CardId` (`OracleId` alias) | Build script | One catalog build |
| Printing | set code + collector number | Set file | Stable bibliography |
| Game object | `CardInstanceId`, `PermanentId` | Engine | One game or battlefield stay |

Never persist or hand-author a `CardId`. Adding a definition can change sorted interning and
renumber handles. Printings, decklists, tests, and scripted code use `FunctionalId` and
resolve it through `CardDatabase::card_id` when a handle is needed.

## Adding a card

1. Add `data/catalog/<functional_id>.json` with schema version `1` and a matching id.
2. Add or update a set file if the card needs a printing record.
3. Add behavior tests using the card’s `functional_id`.
4. Run `make check`.

Adding a functional definition creates one catalog file; adding a printing may also edit its
set file.

## Validation

The build and loader reject:

- unknown fields or malformed JSON;
- unsupported schema versions;
- malformed, duplicate, or file-mismatched functional ids;
- missing types or invalid creature power/toughness;
- an Aura grant on a non-Aura;
- unresolved printing references or duplicate collector numbers; and
- disagreement between a scripted definition and `src/scripted.rs`.

Breaking schema changes increment `SCHEMA_VERSION` and migrate the entire catalog in the
same change. Unsupported versions fail rather than being skipped.
