# RUNE protocol

A RUNE connection speaks two phases over one WebSocket (or an in-process call for
WASM/FFI deployments). Before a game exists it speaks a **small lobby message
set** (`LobbyView` out, `LobbyCommand` in — full lobby state every message, same
philosophy as `GameView`); the instant a game is constructed it speaks **exactly
the two in-game message types** (`GameView` out, `ChooseAction` in) for the life
of that game. Any client — web UI, CLI, LLM agent — speaks exactly this.
**Changing any shape here requires updating `rune-protocol` and this document in
the same PR.**

> **On "the entire API is two messages."** The two *in-game* messages
> (`GameView` / `ChooseAction`) are still the whole contract for a game already in
> progress. They are now **flanked** by the lobby pair (`LobbyView` /
> `LobbyCommand`) that governs the pre-game phase and hands off to the in-game
> contract at game construction (docs/decisions/0012-lobby-protocol.md). Both
> pairs obey the same discipline: full personalized state pushed every message,
> the client reconstructs its whole UI from one message, and it computes no
> legality of its own.

## Server → client: GameView

Personalized per player (hidden information is redacted server-side; the client
never receives what its player may not know). The concrete types live in the
`rune-protocol` crate; the wire format is their serde JSON.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `you` | `PlayerId` | The receiver's own seat entity id (same `p{N}` form used for players). Lets a client identify itself directly. A client that receives a payload without it (older server) treats it as `""`/unknown |
| `my_hand` | `CardView[]` | Full card objects for the receiving player only |
| `me` | `SelfView` | The receiver's own public stats: `life`, `library_size`. The self-counterpart of an `OpponentView` — a player's own life and library size are public, so this exposes no hidden information. A client that receives a payload without it (older server) treats it as a zero placeholder |
| `opponents` | `OpponentView[]` | `player_id`, `hand_size`, `life`, `library_size`, `graveyard_size`, `statuses` |
| `battlefield` | `Permanent[]` | Permanents with `controller`, `owner`, computed `card`, `tapped`, `attacking`, `blocking`, `damage`, `counters` (a `Counter[]`, see below) |
| `stack` | `StackItem[]` | Spells and abilities; ability entries carry `source` + display text |
| `graveyards`, `exile` | `ZonePile[]` | Public ordered lists per player |
| `phase` | `Phase` | Current turn step (snake_case enum); drives overview/focus mode |
| `turn` | `number` | Current turn number (1-based; `0` only in an empty state). The server owns turn counting — the client renders this, it never counts turns itself. A payload without it (older server) is treated as `0` |
| `active_player` | `PlayerId` | Whose turn it is (the active player), as a `p{N}` id. Distinct from `priority_player`: the active player owns the turn even while an opponent holds priority. Omitted when empty; a payload without it (older server) is treated as `""`/unknown |
| `mana_pool` | `string[]` | The receiving player's unspent mana as pip strings (e.g. `["{G}"]`); server-computed, display-only. Omitted when empty |
| `priority_player` | `PlayerId?` | Who holds priority now, if anyone |
| `valid_actions` | `ValidAction[]` | See below — the only source of interactivity |
| `action_deadline` | `number?` | Seconds remaining for the pending decision, present only for the deciding seat when the room runs a decision clock (issue #263). Server-authoritative and derived from an **absolute** deadline, so each re-send (including a reconnect) carries the true remaining time rather than restarting the clock; the client displays a live countdown but never enforces it. The timer policy is a room setting, **off by default** (unchanged behavior); when on, an expired decision has the server take a conservative default action (pass priority, or an empty combat declaration) on the player's behalf — never a concession. In-game decisions only; the lobby/deck-submission phase is out of scope |
| `result` | `GameResult?` | The terminal outcome once the game is over (CR 104.2a). Omitted while the game is live; when present, `valid_actions` is empty. See [Game over](#game-over-result) |

Empty collections and absent optionals are omitted from the JSON; clients must
treat a missing field as its empty/`null` default.

### CardView

A `CardView` carries a card's server-computed characteristics for display: `id`,
`name`, `type_line`, optional `mana_cost`, `rules_text`, `functional_id`,
`power`/`toughness` (strings, present only for creatures), and `keywords`.

- `rules_text` — the card's rules text, **generated** by the server from the card's
  ability IR ([ADR 0018](decisions/0018-scalable-functional-card-definitions.md) §7),
  never a stored string: no rules prose is committed anywhere in the repository, and
  this is **not** exact Oracle text. It is written to be semantically complete enough
  to play with; matching official wording is explicitly not a goal. Generation is
  deterministic (same card, same string) and its coverage of the IR is compiler-
  enforced. Omitted from the JSON for a card with no rules.
- `functional_id` — the card's **stable presentation identity**: the authored
  `functional_id` of the card definition this object is a copy of (ADR 0018 §3, §8).
  Unlike `id`, which is a per-game entity handle, it is the same string for every copy
  of a card in every game and survives a server rebuild. It exists so a future
  *client-local* cache could enrich presentation by identity; the server has no such
  cache and requires none, and a client that ignores this field renders the card
  completely from the fields above. Omitted only for a card the server cannot resolve.

- `keywords` — the card's keyword abilities (CR 702) as an array of lowercase wire
  names, e.g. `["flying"]` or `["first_strike", "trample"]`. Server-computed and
  display-only; the client renders badges and never derives combat behavior from
  them (which creatures may block, and how damage is dealt, is decided by the
  engine and surfaced through `valid_actions` and the battlefield). Omitted from
  the JSON when the card has no keywords.

### Game over: result

When the game ends (CR 104.2a), the view carries a `result` object and
`valid_actions` becomes empty; further actions the client submits are rejected and
the same final view is re-sent. While the game is live `result` is **omitted
entirely** (the empty-optional convention), so its mere presence signals game over.

```json
{ "winner": "p0", "losers": ["p1"], "reason": "decked" }
```

- `winner` — the surviving player's id (CR 104.2a). Omitted for a draw, where every
  remaining player lost at once (CR 104.4a).
- `losers` — the players who lost, in seat order.
- `reason` — why the game ended, a snake_case enum: `life_zero` (a player at 0 or
  less life, CR 704.5a), `decked` (a player attempted to draw from an empty library,
  CR 704.5c), or `concede` (a player conceded, CR 104.3a).

The losing conditions are unified server-side; a player may always **concede** — a
`concede` action is offered in `valid_actions` in every phase (CR 104.3a). The
client renders the result; it never decides a winner or terminality itself.

### Combat state on a Permanent

A permanent carries its combat declaration state (CR 508/509), server-computed
and display-only like every other characteristic:

- `attacking` — `true` while the permanent is a declared attacker this combat.
  Omitted (treated as `false`) when it is not attacking.
- `blocking` — the entity id of the attacker this permanent is blocking, when it
  is a declared blocker. Omitted (`null`) when it is not blocking. Several
  blockers may name the same attacker; a blocker names exactly one attacker.
- `damage` — combat damage marked on this permanent this turn (CR 120.3), an
  unsigned integer. This is the value the engine's lethal-damage state-based
  action compares against toughness (CR 704.5g); it accumulates during the
  combat-damage step (CR 510) and is cleared at cleanup (CR 514.2). Omitted
  (treated as `0`) when no damage is marked.

All three are omitted from the JSON in the common not-in-combat, undamaged case,
so a permanent outside combat keeps its terse wire shape. The client renders
these; it never derives combat legality or lethality (which creatures may attack
or block, and which die, is decided by the engine and surfaced through the view
and `valid_actions`).

### Counter

A permanent's `counters` is an array of `Counter` objects, each a named counter
and its quantity. Both fields are required:

```json
{ "kind": "+1/+1", "count": 2 }
```

- `kind` — the counter name as displayed, e.g. `"+1/+1"` or `"loyalty"`.
- `count` — how many of that counter are present (an unsigned integer).

The server computes these; clients display them verbatim and never derive them.
The whole array is omitted when a permanent has no counters.

### valid_actions[]

```json
{ "id": "a2", "type": "activate_ability", "label": "Tap for mana",
  "subject": ["perm_xyz"], "token": "h:00ab" }
```

- `subject` lists the entity ids this action belongs to. Clients render
  entity-subject actions on the entity; subject-less actions (pass, end turn)
  go in the action bar (ADR 0004).
- Entity ids are opaque strings and are **per physical instance**: two copies of
  the same printed card in a zone carry different card entity ids, so an action
  subject names exactly one copy. Clients treat these ids as opaque handles and
  never parse them (the `card_N`/`perm_N` forms are server-internal).
- `type` is a free-form string. Kinds emitted today: `pass_priority`
  (subject-less); `play_land` and `cast_spell` (subject = the hand card's entity
  id); `activate_ability` (subject = the source permanent's entity id);
  `declare_attackers` and `declare_blockers` (subject-less combat declarations,
  CR 508/509, carrying their multi-select candidate `requirements` — see below).
  Clients key off `type`/`subject`/`label` and tolerate unknown kinds.
- `token` is a **content-binding token** (ADR 0009): a server-issued value bound
  to this action's exact content (kind + subject + requirements). The client
  echoes it back verbatim in `ChooseAction`; the server recomputes it from the
  freshly regenerated action and rejects any answer whose token does not match.
  This stops a stale positional `id` (e.g. `a2`) from silently rebinding to a
  *different* action once decisions stop being strictly sequential. Specified as
  a hash/echo of the action content so the server stays stateless (it remembers
  no per-id secret; it recomputes). Opaque — clients never parse or derive it.
  Omitted when unbound (older server); an omitted/`""` token matches no real
  action and is safely rejected.

#### Multi-step actions: `requirements`

A targeted spell/ability (and later modes and X) carries an ordered
`requirements` list — one entry per choice slot the player must fill before the
action can be taken:

```json
{ "id": "a3", "type": "cast_spell", "label": "Cast Lightning Bolt",
  "subject": ["c3"], "token": "h:9f2c",
  "requirements": [
    { "slot": "t0", "prompt": "target creature or player",
      "candidates": ["perm_bear", "p1", "p2"] }
  ] }
```

- Each requirement is one target slot: `slot` (opaque id the answer keys back
  to), `prompt` (human-readable spec label to display), and `candidates` (the
  legal entity ids the server enumerated — the **only** choices the client may
  offer). The server computes legality; the client highlights exactly these
  candidates and derives nothing (ADR 0009 §Client).
- `candidates` is enumerated O(N) per slot, never the cartesian product of
  combinations across slots (ADR 0009 §Enumeration).
- The client walks `requirements` as a prompt queue and submits **all** answers
  in a single `ChooseAction` (see below) — never a stateful multi-message
  handshake. The effect IR that backs these actions is decided in ADR 0007.
- Absent/empty for a plain action that needs no sub-choice.

#### Prompt slots: `option`, `select_from_zone`, `order`

Alongside the target `requirements`, a `ValidAction` may carry a `prompts` list —
**generalizations of the same slot pattern** (slot + prompt + candidates, bound by
the action's `token`, ADR 0009), for choices that are not target selection. A
`prompts` entry is tagged by `kind` and answered by the **same** `targets`/`chosen`
mechanism keyed by `slot` (see `ChooseAction` below): the client walks
`requirements` and `prompts` as one prompt queue and submits every slot atomically
in a single message. The action's content-binding `token` folds in the prompts too,
so ADR 0009's reject-stale protection covers all three shapes. `prompts` is
absent/empty for an action that poses no such choice; clients tolerate an unknown
future `kind`.

- **`option`** — pick exactly one of N named choices (also the clean shape for a
  yes/no). Carries `options[]` of `{ id, label }`; the answer's `chosen` is the
  single chosen option `id`. Emitted by the server for the pre-game **mulligan
  keep/take-another decision** (`mulligan_decision` action, CR 103.5), which
  collapses the former separate `keep`/`mulligan` actions into one.

  ```json
  { "id": "a0", "type": "mulligan_decision", "label": "Keep or mulligan",
    "token": "t00000000deadbeef",
    "prompts": [
      { "kind": "option", "slot": "decision",
        "prompt": "Keep this hand or take a mulligan?",
        "options": [ { "id": "keep", "label": "Keep this hand" },
                     { "id": "mulligan", "label": "Mulligan" } ] }
    ] }
  ```

- **`select_from_zone`** — pick `count` cards from a zone. Carries `zone` (e.g.
  `"hand"`), `owner` (the `PlayerId` whose zone it is), `count`, and the legal
  `candidates[]` entity ids; the answer's `chosen` lists the selected ids. Emitted
  by the server for the **cleanup discard-to-maximum** (`discard` action, CR 514.1 —
  `count: 1`, collapsing the former per-card `discard` actions into one) and for the
  **mulligan bottoming** owed after a mulligan (carried on the same
  `mulligan_decision` action; London bottoming rides ADR 0009's `requirements` slot,
  and a keep answers both `decision` and the bottoming slot).

  ```json
  { "id": "a0", "type": "discard", "label": "Discard a card",
    "token": "t0000000000c0ffee",
    "prompts": [
      { "kind": "select_from_zone", "slot": "discard",
        "prompt": "Choose a card to discard",
        "zone": "hand", "owner": "p0", "count": 1,
        "candidates": ["card_10", "card_11", "card_12"] }
    ] }
  ```

- **`order`** — arrange N items into an order. Carries `items[]` (the entity ids to
  arrange); the answer's `chosen` is a permutation of exactly those ids. Intended for
  **ordering simultaneous triggers** (APNAP, CR 603.3b) and later **scry**. No server
  state emits it yet — the engine does not pose a trigger-ordering choice until that
  lands (issue #151) — so it is a documented, round-tripped shape without a live
  projection.

  ```json
  { "id": "a0", "type": "order_triggers", "label": "Order triggers",
    "token": "t0",
    "prompts": [
      { "kind": "order", "slot": "triggers",
        "prompt": "Order these triggered abilities",
        "items": ["stack_1", "stack_2"] }
    ] }
  ```

The same `requirements` shape carries every server-computed candidate set, not
just ability targets. A slot's `candidates` are the engine's freshly computed
legal set, so a rebuilt view always advertises current candidates:

- **Mulligan bottoming** (`keep`, CR 103.5 London): one slot `"bottom"` whose
  `candidates` are the deciding seat's hand-card entity ids, one to choose per
  mulligan taken. Absent for a first-hand keep (nothing owed).

  ```json
  { "id": "a1", "type": "keep", "label": "Keep hand", "token": "h:5c1d",
    "requirements": [
      { "slot": "bottom", "prompt": "Put 1 card(s) on the bottom of your library",
        "candidates": ["card_7", "card_8"] } ] }
  ```

- **Declare attackers** (`declare_attackers`, CR 508.1a): one slot `"attackers"`
  whose `candidates` are the eligible attacking creatures. Absent when none may
  attack.
- **Declare blockers** (`declare_blockers`, CR 509.1a): one slot **per declared
  attacker** (`"block_<id>"`), each listing the defender's eligible blockers to
  assign to that attacker; the answer's `chosen` names the blockers assigned to
  it. Absent when there is nothing to block or nothing to block with.

  ```json
  { "id": "a1", "type": "declare_blockers", "label": "Declare blockers",
    "token": "h:2b90",
    "requirements": [
      { "slot": "block_12", "prompt": "Choose blockers for Verdant Scout",
        "candidates": ["perm_20"] } ] }
  ```

These combat declarations are **optional** multi-selects: an empty selection
(answering with no `targets`, or a slot left unfilled) legally declares no
attackers/blockers, unlike a mandatory ability-target slot which must be filled.
The server still validates every submitted id against the slot's current
candidates and rejects anything else.

## Client → server: ChooseAction

For a plain, no-choice action the message is just the id (and, once servers
issue them, the action's `token`):

```json
{ "type": "choose_action", "action_id": "a2", "token": "h:00ab" }
```

For a multi-step action the client submits its whole selection atomically —
`token` plus one `targets` entry per `requirements` slot:

```json
{ "type": "choose_action", "action_id": "a3", "token": "h:9f2c",
  "targets": [ { "slot": "t0", "chosen": ["perm_bear"] } ] }
```

- `token` echoes the chosen action's `token` verbatim (content binding above).
- `targets[]` answers the action's requirement **and** prompt slots: `slot`
  matches a `requirements[].slot` or a `prompts[].slot`, and `chosen` lists the
  selected ids for it — one for a single-target slot; a chosen option `id` for an
  `option`; the selected zone ids for a `select_from_zone`; the full ordering for
  an `order`. Every id must be one of that slot's advertised
  candidates/options/items, or the server treats the action as a no-op.
- `token` and `targets` are omitted when empty, so the minimal message above
  stays valid. The server validates the id, verifies the token against the
  action it currently offers, and re-checks each chosen target against that
  slot's freshly computed legal set; anything else is rejected and the current
  GameView is re-sent.

## Lobby phase

Before a game exists the connection speaks the lobby pair. It is the pre-game
analogue of the in-game contract: the server pushes a full `LobbyView` on every
change and the client rebuilds its entire pre-game UI (identity, room, seat
roster, who is decked/ready) from that one message. `valid_commands` is the only
source of interactivity, exactly as `valid_actions` is in `GameView`; the client
computes no legality. Hidden information stays redacted server-side — a
`LobbyView` never leaks another seat's decklist, only that the seat is decked.
When every seat is simultaneously filled, decked, and ready the server constructs
the game and the connection begins receiving `GameView`s; there is no auto-start
and no game with empty decks. All lobby types live in `rune-protocol`; the wire
format is their serde JSON, and unknown fields are ignored (forward compat).

### Server → client: LobbyView

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `session` | `SessionToken` (string) | The connection's opaque session/reconnect token. The client stores it and echoes it on a later `hello`. Always present on the wire; treated as `""` if a payload omits it. **Private** — it is the client's own handle, distinct from the public `you` shown to other seats |
| `you` | `PlayerId` (string) | The connection's public player identity, used to match itself against a seat's `occupied_by`. `""` if absent |
| `room` | `RoomView?` | The room the connection is in, if any (see below). Omitted when not in a room |
| `directory` | `RoomSummary[]` | The public **room directory** (see below): every browsable room in the lobby, so a player can discover and join an open game without an out-of-band id. Re-projected and pushed on every room lifecycle change like the rest of the view. Omitted from the wire when empty; a missing field is an empty list |
| `valid_commands` | `string[]` | The lobby command kinds currently legal for this connection (e.g. `"create_room"`, `"join_room"`, `"submit_deck"`, `"ready"`, `"unready"`, `"leave"`). Free-form strings; clients render exactly these and tolerate unknown kinds. Omitted when empty |

#### RoomView

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `room_id` | `RoomId` (string) | Opaque room id, shared out-of-band to invite a second player |
| `config` | `RoomConfig` | The room's configuration (see below) |
| `seats` | `SeatView[]` | The seat roster, in seat order. Omitted when empty |

#### RoomConfig

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `seats` | `number` (u8) | Number of seats, validated server-side into the inclusive range `2..=8`. The lobby supports 2–8 seats even while the engine remains two-player |
| `game_setup` | `GameSetupId` (string) | Opaque game-setup id naming which setup (players, starting life, hand size, …) the room builds its game from. The catalogue is owned by ADR 0013; the server validates the id against its format registry (ADR 0013 §4) — a `create_room` naming an unknown id is rejected and no room is opened |

#### SeatView

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `seat` | `number` (u8) | Zero-based seat index within the room |
| `occupied_by` | `PlayerId?` | The player occupying this seat; omitted when the seat is empty |
| `decked` | `bool` | Whether this seat has submitted a server-validated deck. Contents are never exposed to other seats — only this flag. Omitted (false) when not decked |
| `ready` | `bool` | Whether this seat has declared itself ready. Omitted (false) when not ready |

#### RoomSummary (directory entry)

One `directory` entry: a room as it appears in the public room browser. It carries
**only** what discovery needs — the id, the config summary, an occupancy count, and
the lifecycle state — and never a seat roster, a decklist, or any game state (a
browser, not a spectator feed; spectating a live game is out of scope).

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `room_id` | `RoomId` (string) | The room's opaque id — the same id a `join_room` command carries, so a client joins straight from the listing |
| `config` | `RoomConfig` | The room's configuration (`seats`, `game_setup`): the config summary the browser shows |
| `filled` | `number` (u8) | How many of the room's seats are occupied. The total is `config.seats`; a `gathering` room with `filled` below that has an open seat to join |
| `state` | `RoomState` (string) | The room's lifecycle state, a snake_case enum: `gathering` (pre-game, joinable while it has an open seat) or `in_progress` (its game has started — visible for context but **not** joinable). A finished or emptied room simply leaves the directory |

```json
{ "session": "s:ab12", "you": "p1",
  "room": { "room_id": "r:7f3",
    "config": { "seats": 2, "game_setup": "standard_2p" },
    "seats": [
      { "seat": 0, "occupied_by": "p1", "decked": true, "ready": true },
      { "seat": 1, "occupied_by": "p2", "decked": true } ] },
  "directory": [
    { "room_id": "r:7f3", "config": { "seats": 2, "game_setup": "standard_2p" },
      "filled": 2, "state": "gathering" },
    { "room_id": "r:9a1", "config": { "seats": 4, "game_setup": "ffa-4" },
      "filled": 4, "state": "in_progress" } ],
  "valid_commands": ["submit_deck", "unready", "leave"] }
```

Empty collections and absent optionals are omitted from the JSON; clients treat a
missing field as its empty/`null` default.

### Client → server: LobbyCommand

A single tagged message the client sends to act, structurally parallel to
`choose_action`. The server validates every command against authoritative state
and answers with a fresh `LobbyView`; an invalid command is rejected and the
current `LobbyView` re-sent. The `type` discriminator selects the command:

| `type` | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `token?` (`SessionToken`) | First contact or reconnect. Carries a previously issued session token to reclaim a held-open seat, echoed verbatim; omitted on a fresh connection (server then issues a new identity) |
| `create_room` | `config` (`RoomConfig`) | Create a new room; the reply's `RoomView` carries the freshly issued `room_id` |
| `join_room` | `room_id` (`RoomId`) | Join an existing room by id. The id may come from the `LobbyView` room `directory` (browse and join in-band) or be shared out-of-band; there is still no matchmaking (nothing auto-pairs players) |
| `submit_deck` | `cards` (`CardIdentity[]`) | Submit a decklist as a flat list of opaque card-identity handles (a card appearing multiple times is repeated). An identity is a card's authored `functional_id` — a lowercase `snake_case` slug like `thornback_boar` (ADR 0018 §3), **not** the engine's `CardId`, which is interned per build and shifts as cards are added. The server validates it authoritatively: every identity must resolve against the card database, and the whole decklist must be legal for the room's format (deck size and per-card copy limit, basic lands exempt — deck legality is server/format policy, never an engine rule, ADR 0013 §4). An illegal deck is rejected and the seat left undecked; `cards` is omitted when empty |
| `ready` | `ready` (`bool`) | Declare (`true`) or retract (`false`) readiness. A seat may ready only once it is occupied and decked |
| `leave` | — | Leave the current room, vacating the seat |

```json
{ "type": "hello", "token": "s:ab12" }
{ "type": "create_room", "config": { "seats": 2, "game_setup": "standard_2p" } }
{ "type": "join_room", "room_id": "r:7f3" }
{ "type": "submit_deck", "cards": ["thornback_boar", "thornback_boar", "forest"] }
{ "type": "ready", "ready": true }
{ "type": "leave" }
```

Card identities and the `game_setup` catalogue are opaque here; their
identity-vs-printing model and values are owned by ADR 0013. Per the project's
legal rules these are card *identities*, never printings, images, or WotC
branding.

## Invariants

- The client is stateless with respect to rules: a fresh `GameView` (in game) or
  `LobbyView` (pre-game) must fully reconstruct the UI — reconnect, spectate, and
  resync all depend on this.
- `valid_actions` (in game) and `valid_commands` (lobby) are the only sources of
  interactivity; the client renders exactly what it is given and computes no
  legality of its own.
- Displayed values (P/T, counters, costs) are server-computed; clients never derive.
- Unknown fields must be ignored by clients (forward compatibility).
