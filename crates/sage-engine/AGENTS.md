# Engine agent guide

`sage-engine` is the pure, deterministic rules state machine. Read the engine section of
[`docs/brief.md`](../../docs/brief.md) before changing it.

## Hard rules

- Pure functions over immutable `GameState`. `apply_action` clones; it never mutates.
- **No dependencies on tokio, networking, timers, threads, wall-clock time, or randomness
  without an injected seed.** Runtime dependencies are limited to serde for embedded card
  data; adding another dependency requires an ADR.
- No listeners/observers. Triggers are collected by diffing before/after states.
  Characteristics are computed fresh by pure functions (layer system), never cached.
- Every permanent gets a fresh `PermanentId` on battlefield entry — zone-change identity
  is the mechanism, do not add zone-change counters.
- Every rules behavior change ships with tests in the same PR. Rules bugs get a
  regression test named after the issue (`issue_123_...`).
- Cards are **data**, authored against [`docs/card-schema.md`](../../docs/card-schema.md):
  a functional definition per card under a stable `functional_id`, no presentation
  assets (the schema rejects them structurally), and code-defined behavior only via the
  declared `scripted` escape hatch.
- **Never write a `CardId` down.** `build.rs` assembles `data/catalog/` + `data/sets/`
  at compile time and interns `CardId(0..n)` from the sorted `FunctionalId`s (ADR 0018
  §3), so authoring one card renumbers its neighbours. Name a card by its
  `functional_id` and resolve the handle (`CardDatabase::card_id`) — in decklists, in
  `scripted.rs`, and in tests (`crate::fixtures::fixture`).
- `build.rs` may read catalog files at compile time. The running engine performs no I/O.
  Shared validators live in `src/catalog.rs` so build-time and load-time checks agree.
- **Automation policy belongs to the server, not here.** The engine may expose pure rules
  *predicates* (`automation.rs`); the loop, the per-seat preferences, and the pacing
  decisions live in the room layer (ADR 0020). This seam is the reason the engine stays
  sustainable — do not move policy across it.

## The IR is the constraint

Catalog coverage is limited by what the ability IR can *express*, not by authoring
throughput. Today `Cost` has one variant (`Tap`), `TriggerCondition` two (both about the
source itself), `PlayerRef` one (`Controller`), and `TargetSpec` five unrestricted variants;
there is **no static-ability variant at all**, so every `Modification` fed to the layer
system comes from a spell effect, combat, or action generation — never from a card's printed
static ability. A lord, an anthem, or a cost reducer is therefore not writable.

The bundled 61 cards were selected as cards this vocabulary can say, so the empty
`scripted.rs` table is not evidence of expressiveness. Growing the vocabulary is the primary
engine workstream; each new primitive is one enum variant plus every exhaustive match that
consumes it, across the resolver and the server's rules-text formatter.
